The code was originally for a school project, and working alone, git
was simply used as a cool way to transfer files, so there are many
savepoints with very improper commit messages.

Take a look at the files in basic, for things to override for a
specific problem.  There are probably better ways to do things,
especially configurations, but this is whats worked.
